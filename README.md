# Fake Blog Post Things

This is my first Next.js personal project where I create a solo blog site for myself.

## Goals

- Create a site where I can login, post, and delete Blog Posts on the site
- Using Dynamic Routing, I can create posts dynamically and go to it's page contents automatically.
- Create a login authenticator for logging in.
- Decorate the webpage with my nice 'Mocha' flavor color palette.
- Fill the page with nice blogs and random trivia!

### Changelog

(2/7/2024) but in the evening:
> I managed to deploy the site onto Vercel after some modifications.
> I needed to go from using SQlite to Vercel Postgre which ended up being easier than I thought the second time around. I tried using it without Prisma, but it was kinda confusing, but using Prisma with it was easier.
> This will probably be the last commit I make for this project. I do want to start creating others with different frameworks and options.

(2/7/2024):
> Bro, I forgot I have a README file. I've been doing the changelog on the commits for no reason. To sum up the things I've done til this point, I've added: *Authentication* and a login page, *Transitions* for each page and interaction, created a *database* that holds all my blogs, created a *blog maker* page to easily create more blogs, created a way to *edit and delete blogs*, and finally added some *coffee pictures* to make it more cozy-esque.
> For the final stretch, I want to add a little more spice to it before deploying it.  

(1/29/2024):
> I haven't actually done any changelog before this, but I did do a lot. Up til this point, I had done: the Home, Blogs, and About Me pages with their respective contents (except for the About Me page).
