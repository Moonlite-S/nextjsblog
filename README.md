# Fake Blog Post Things

This is my first Next.js personal project where I create a solo blog site for myself.

## Goals

- Create a site where I can login, post, and delete Blog Posts on the site
- Using Dynamic Routing, I can create posts dynamically and go to it's page contents automatically.
- Create a login authenticator for logging in.
- Decorate the webpage with my nice 'Mocha' flavor color palette.
- Fill the page with nice blogs and random trivia!
